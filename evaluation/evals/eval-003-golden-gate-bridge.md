**Category:** real-world
**Difficulty:** hard

## What This Tests

Tests the agent's ability to recreate a famous real-world landmark with proper aesthetics, terrain integration, and architectural accuracy.

**Why it's challenging:**
- Recognizable real-world structure with specific features
- Suspension cables require catenary curve math
- Terrain integration (water, land on both ends)
- Architectural details (tower cross-bracing, road deck)
- Proper proportions and iconic red color

---

## Expected Output

**Architecture:**
- [ ] Two main towers with cross-bracing
- [ ] Suspension cables with catenary curves
- [ ] Road deck spanning between towers
- [ ] Iconic red/orange color (red concrete, red wool, etc.)

**Terrain:**
- [ ] Water/ocean beneath the bridge
- [ ] Land/terrain on both ends
- [ ] Bridge properly anchored to terrain

**Aesthetics:**
- [ ] Recognizable as Golden Gate Bridge
- [ ] Proper proportions (towers taller than wide)
- [ ] Visual detail (cable patterns, tower structure)

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| No terrain | Bridge floating in void without water or land |
| Straight cables | Suspension cables are diagonal lines instead of curves |
| Missing cross-bracing | Towers are solid blocks instead of structural lattice |
| Wrong color | Using gray/white instead of iconic red |
