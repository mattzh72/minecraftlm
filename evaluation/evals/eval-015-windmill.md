## What This Tests

A simpler eval testing baseline creativity. Windmills have distinctive features (rotating blades, tower structure) that should be present. Tests whether agent adds appropriate terrain context.

**Why it's challenging:**
- Blade design requires creativity (not just flat rectangles)
- Tower structure variety (traditional Dutch vs modern wind turbine)
- Terrain/context adds to realism
- Proportions matter (blades vs tower size)

## Expected Output

**Structure:**
- [ ] Tower/base structure
- [ ] Rotating blade assembly at top
- [ ] 3-4 blades (typical windmill)
- [ ] Blades have reasonable shape (not single blocks)
- [ ] Cap/nacelle where blades attach

**Terrain:**
- [ ] Ground beneath windmill
- [ ] Terrain extends beyond just the base
- [ ] Optional: grass, path, fence, flowers
- [ ] Optional: hills or flat farmland context

**Creativity:**
- [ ] Interesting design (Dutch traditional or modern turbine)
- [ ] Details (windows, door, balcony for traditional)
- [ ] Material variety
