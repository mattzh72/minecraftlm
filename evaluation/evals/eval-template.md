## Categories

| Category | What it tests |
|----------|---------------|
| `geometry` | Shapes, curves, symmetry, spatial math |
| `counting` | Exact quantities ("10 flags", "7 windows") |
| `spatial-coherence` | Connected scenes, no floating elements |
| `aesthetics` | Design quality, Minecraft style |
| `real-world` | Known buildings/structures |
| `modification` | Editing existing builds |
| `error-recovery` | Handling validation failures |

## Difficulty

| Level | Blocks | Complexity |
|-------|--------|------------|
| `easy` | <50 | Single structure, clear requirements |
| `medium` | 50-200 | Multi-part, some ambiguity |
| `hard` | 200+ | Complex geometry, precise requirements |
